            <h2>ARTIFICIAL INTELLEGENCE</h2><br>
            <p>rtificial Intelligence and Data Science (AI&DS) is an emerging field growing exponentially which consists of a set of tools and techniques used to extract useful knowledge from data. With the increasing demand for undergraduates for AI and DS domain in the Global market over the last few years influenced us to let the students provide a platform to explore them in this trending domain. 
              Building human-level thought processes through the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) is the state-of-the-art in Computer Science. Intelligent machines are influenced by emerging technologies, smart devices, sensors, computing power, faster data processing, huge storage and human-machine interaction capabilities. Data Science (DS) is an interdisciplinary field with the ability to extract knowledge/insights from data - be it structured, unstructured, or semi-structured data.
              AI and DS delivers data driven solution using computational principles, methods and systems for extracting knowledge from data and modern computational systems that demonstrate capabilities of perception, reasoning, learning and action that are typical of human intelligence. <br><br>
